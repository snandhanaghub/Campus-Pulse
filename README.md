# Campus Pulse â€“ Events Hub @ Model Engineering College

## Overview
**Campus Pulse** is a comprehensive full-stack event management platform developed to centralize and streamline campus-wide communication at Model Engineering College. The platform addresses the long-standing challenge of fragmented announcements spread across multiple informal channels, ensuring that students, faculty, and administrators receive timely and relevant updates in a structured, accessible format.

By integrating **React.js** for a dynamic frontend, **Node.js/Express.js** for a robust backend, and a **MySQL relational database** for secure data management, Campus Pulse provides role-specific access, automated real-time notifications, and intuitive event discovery. The system improves operational efficiency for event organizers and fosters greater student engagement.
